        Below is my finished CARP poster alongside my CARP Template. 
    </p>

    <p class="CARP-text">
        My Carp Psoster was produced in Adobe InDesign and contains the application of different typographic systems that I learnt during the semester and produced in Adobe Illustrator.
        I wanted to include a connection between my CARP Project and my Typography Project to convey that I understand how to apply typographic systems
        to different forms of digital products.
    </p>

    <p class="CARP-text">
         These typographic sysgtems present consist of Grid, within the information blocks,
        Dilational, surrounding the radial gradient moon, and some aspects of Transitional, seen through the creation of the mountains.
