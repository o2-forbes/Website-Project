    Below is my finished CARP poster alongside my CARP Template.

    <div class="container">

            <p class="CARP-text">
                My CARP Template contains my initial plan for the creation and design of my poster. 
                It includes reference labels and sketches which therefore helped me in the production phase of this task. 
           </p>
        
            <p class="CARP-text">
                My Carp Poster was produced in Adobe InDesign and contains the application of different typographic systems that I learnt during the semester and produced in Adobe Illustrator.
                I wanted to include a connection between my CARP and Typography Project to convey that I understand how to apply typographic systems
                to different forms of digital products.
            </p>
        
            <p class="CARP-text">
                The typographic systems present in the poster consist of Grid, within the information blocks,
                Dilational, surrounding the radial gradient moon, and some aspects of Transitional, seen through the creation of the mountains. 
            </p>
        
            <p class="CARP-text">
              The repeating contrast between black, white and linear/radial gradients create a striking monochromatic theme across the poster and all my projects that enhances certain aspects of the products to create more visually appealing designs. As well as this,
              the recurring border styles and fonts used reinforce a continual theme. 
           </p>
        
           <p class="CARP-text">
                There is an equal proximity between the text that have a relationship with eachother
                and text that are dissimilar. For example, the text within the information blocks are postioned close to eachother, as they are related, 
                while they are further away from information regarding registration costs, by the moon. 
           </p>
        
           <p class="CARP-text">
                The inclusion of a border supports the alignment of my poster. The postioning of the text and the various design styles are equal in relation to the border
                which creates a satisying look to the poster and its attributes.
