<p class="CARP-text"> My Wireframe contains my initial plan for the creation and design of my website template. 
It includes reference labels and sketches which therefore helped me progress in the production phase of this task. </p>

<p class="CARP-text">A wireframe is intended to plan the production of a website
    and consists of a visual representation along with an outline that depicts the basic structure and layout of the web page. 
    It is a simplified design that focuses on the placement of elements, such as navigation, content, and functionality,
    without incorporating detailed design elements like colors, images, or specific fonts. </p>

    <p class="CARP-text">
        My first worksheet I completed, GWDS-Weekly-Coding-Sheets, focused on the very basics of HTML. It concentrated on the simple concepts
        of having to encase the entire HTML file within the HTML tag as well as doing the same for the body elements. 
        The body elements being the foundation of your HTML file that will be expanded on in the CSS file that
        we later learnt to link. DOCTYPE declares information to the browser about what document type to expect.
        Finally, all I had to partake in was the simple task of writing a line of text on the web page that stated
        "This is my first worksheet for GWDS."
    </p>

    <p class="CARP-text">
        The other worksheet, HTML-CSS, was an expansion of the understanding of HTMl and also introduced the application of CSS.
        It focused on many different HTML elements including the simple use of p, h, li, ul, ol, header, and footer, but also the more complicated
        yet important aspects of div, class, section, and main. 

        CSS opened up many opportunities and concepts that will benefit me. I learnt how to apply different styles to my text and change the visibile aspects of my fonts,
        the implementation of borders, and changing the scale and position of certain features.
    </p>    

    <p class="CARP-text">
        Progressing by applying these new ideas will help me develop and increase my knowledge
        of HTML and CSS by a large margin.
