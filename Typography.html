        <p class="CARP-text">
            Typography is the art and technique of arranging and designing text to make it visually appealing while also retaining its 
            eligibility to be read. It involves selecting typefaces, point sizes, line lengths, line-spacing, 
            and letter-spacing, as well as adjusting the overall layout and its variety of text elements. 
            Typography is a crucial aspect of graphic design, publishing, and various other types of visual communication and art. 
         </p>

          <p class="CARP-text">
            As stated in <a href="https://type365.com/2017/02/21/7-typographic-layout-systems/#axial"><button class="span-link">type365.com:</button></a> 
            </p>

      <p class="CARP-text-type">
          Axial typography consist of lines of text positioned on either side of a line. 
          They can be either symmetrical or asymmetrical around their axis and the lines can be any rotation and scale. 
         </p>

   <p class="CARP-text-type">
    Bilateral typography include text that is formatted in the centre style.
    It can be positioned on alternating areas of the canvas but must be in the style stated before. 
   </p>

   <p class="CARP-text-type">
    Dilatational typography consist of lines of text that are set along different circular paths that bend and curve across the canvas either around a point or a shape. 
    It tends to create a distinct, visually appealing style of typography but must be used wisely as 
    text will appear upside down depending on the scale of rotation and the length of text.
   </p>

   <p class="CARP-text-type">
    Grid typography include text and the composition size. Grids are made up of columns containing appropriate text depending on the subject. The boundaries within the composition must contain margins that
    benefit the readers visibility needs meaning its easy to read. A gap between the columns reinforce this visibility. The lines tend to better if they are symmetrical.
   </p>

   <p class="CARP-text-type">
    Modular typography use repeating structures to break up the content. Grid and Modular typography tend to compliment eachother well.
    The structures within Modular typography can include any form of design and style and are commonly used to seperate topics into sections. 
   </p>

   <p class="CARP-text-type">
    Radial typography consist of lines of text that radiate out of a focal point or surround a structure. This design can very well be
    difficult to read and therefore is mainly appropriate for graphic design such as posters due to the fact its
    visually interesting and captivating. 
   </p>

   <p class="CARP-text-type">
    Random typography is a form of typography with no rules. It can include a variety of different typography and text styles
    while also containing different shapes and structures. 
   </p>

   <p class="CARP-text-type">
    Transitional typography is only ever really appropriate for posters that depend on eye capturing features to engage an audience.
    It consists of lines of text that are positioned to follow structures and the layers that are associated with them. It can be used to create environments, such as mountains, as I did.
