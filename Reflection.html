            Conveying messages effectively through various forms of visual media, incuding both print and web, 
            is a crucial skill for media professionals. Within this module, I learnt the importance of significant aspects 
            of web and graphic design, and applied all of my knowledge and skills gained
            to create a variety of products in which were showcased on my coded website, 
            constructed using various elements of HTML and CSS.

            Entering the Creative Media industry is enhanced by a solid grasp of fundamental graphic design and typographic principles. 
            These visual communication forms pave the way for creative executions. The initial project guides you through these principles, 
            teaching you how to craft compelling, dynamic, and thoughtful creative pieces. 
            These works will become the content for an HTML-coded website, built entirely by you from the ground up.
