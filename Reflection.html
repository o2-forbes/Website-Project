            Conveying messages effectively through various forms of visual media, incuding both print and web, 
            is a crucial skill for media professionals. Within this module, I learnt the importance of significant aspects 
            of web and graphic design, and applied all of my knowledge and skills gained
            to create a variety of products in which were showcased on my coded website, 
            constructed using various elements of HTML and CSS.
        </p>

        <p class="CARP-text">
            Having an enhanced understanding of fundamental graphic design and typographic principles is crucial to create original
            and engaging forms of visual communication within the relevant industry. The variety of 
            projects I undertook and produced taught me how to develop compelling and dynamic creative products showcased on my
            own created html pages.
        </p>        

        <p class="CARP-text">
            I engaged in and created a promotional poster on Adobe InDesign, multiple different forms of typography on Adobe Illustrator, 
            followed and completed several coding worksheets focused on different elements of HTML and CSS that are important to
            understand and apply to my knowedge when producing my final static website as well as to overall develop my skills. 
        </p>

        <p class="CARP-text">
            I employed version control to manage my code by utilizing GitHub desktop. 
            This learning process includeed understanding how to publish and host my constructed website through GitHub. 
            These skills are not only crucial for my academic future but also beneficial in the professional post-university period.
        </p>

        <p class="CARP-text">
            This project served as a way to shoowcase the numerous skills I have learnt and applied throughout this semester and
            materialise on my outward facing website.
            It provides a platform for me to explore and expand my coding abilities, creative passion, all while deepening my comprehension of design principles.
            It also serves up the opportunity to act as a future repository for my other design, interactive, and web projects. 
        </p>

        <p class="CARP-text">
            Creating the poster was a dynamic process that required careful consideration of both an engaging design and visual communication. 
            I started by identifying the key features that will capture the audiences attention, ensuring a clear purpose. The design 
            phase involved experimenting with colours, fonts, typography styles, and layouts to find a visually appealing and effective combination.
            Discussing my poster ideas with fellow students helped refine the poster and improve
            it as I received feedback from a viewers perspective.
        </p>
           
        <p class="CARP-text">
            In retrospect, the project enhanced my visual communication and graphic and web design skills, as
            well as developing my understanding of
            the importance of Contrast, Alignment, Repetition, and Proximity. The experience will prove to be very beneficial
            to me in the future. 
        </p>

        <p class="CARP-text">
            Exploring various forms of typography was creatively beneficial to my graphic design skills. 
            Experimenting with different fonts, styles, and arrangements allowed me to 
            understand how typography influences the overall visual impact relevant to the product.
            This experience expanded my knowledge of typography and understanding of its importance as well as
            highlighting how it enhances visual communication through design and different formats.
         </p>

         <p class="CARP-text">
            I chose to apply a recurring monochromatic colour and gradient theme across all my products to maintain a consistent and stylish look. 
            This choice simplified the design process, making it more convenient to apply across all forms of my products. 
            This single colour palette not only enhanced the thematic recognisability but also provided a visuallly appealing background
            for various design elements to stand out that are intended to
            for the viewing audience. Looking back, it proved to be a practical and effective,
            portraying the importance of colour and linear/radial gradient selection in creating aesthetically pleasing graphic and web designs.
