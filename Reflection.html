        <p class="CARP-text">
            Conveying messages effectively through various forms of visual media,
            is a crucial skill for media professionals. Within this module, I learnt the importance of significant aspects 
            of web and graphic design, and applied all of my knowledge and skills gained
            to create a variety of products. 
        </p>

        <p class="CARP-text">
            Its important to have an enhanced understanding of fundamental graphic design and typographic principles to create original
            and engaging forms of visual communication. The projects I produced taught me how to develop 
            compelling and dynamic creative products showcased on my created website constructed using various elements of HTML and CSS.
        </p>        

        <p class="CARP-text">
            I drew a template for my promotional poster and proceeded to create a material version on Adobe InDesign, 
            produced multiple different forms of typography on Adobe Illustrator, 
            and followed and completed several coding worksheets focused on different elements of HTML and CSS. 
            I applied what was learnt to my final static website.  
        </p>

        <p class="CARP-text">
            I employed version control to manage my code by utilizing GitHub desktop. 
            This learning process includeed understanding how to publish and host my constructed website through GitHub. 
            These skills are not only crucial for my academic future but also beneficial in the professional post-university period.
        </p>

        <p class="CARP-text">
            This project served as a way to show the numerous skills I learnt throughout this semester and materialise on my outward 
            facing website. It provides a platform for me to explore and expand my coding abilities, creative passion, all while deepening 
            my comprehension of design principles. The opportunity to act as a future repository for my other design, 
            interactive, and web projects opens up as well.
        </p>

        <p class="CARP-text">
            Creating the poster was a dynamic process that required careful consideration of both an engaging design and visual communication. 
            I started by identifying the key features that will capture the audiences attention. The design 
            phase involved experimenting with colours, fonts, typography styles, and layouts to find a visually appealing and effective combination.
            Discussing my poster ideas with fellow students helped refine the poster and improve
            it as I received feedback from a viewers perspective.
        </p>
           
        <p class="CARP-text">
            In retrospect, the project enhanced my visual communication and graphic and web design knowledge, as
            well as developing my understanding of
            the importance of Contrast, Alignment, Repetition, and Proximity. The experience will prove to be very beneficial
            to me in the future. 
        </p>

        <p class="CARP-text">
            Exploring various forms of typography was creatively beneficial to my graphic design skills. 
            Experimenting with different fonts, styles, and arrangements allowed me to 
            understand how typography influences the overall visual impact relevant to the product.
            This experience expanded my understanding of typography and its importance as well as highlighting 
            how it enhances visual communication through design and different formats.
         </p>

         <p class="CARP-text">
            I chose to apply a recurring monochromatic colour and gradient theme across all my products to maintain a consistent and stylish look. 
            This choice simplified the design process, making it more convenient to apply across all forms of my products. 
            This single colour palette not only amplified the thematic recognition but also provided a visuallly appealing background
            for various design elements to stand out that are intended to do so for 
            for the viewing audience. Looking back, it proved to be a practical and effective,
            portraying the importance of colour and linear/radial gradient selection in creating aesthetically pleasing graphic and web designs.
